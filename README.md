# COVID-19-Chest-X-ray-Classification-KNN
This project aims to build a complete pattern recognition system to solve classification problems using the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. To classify chest X-ray images into three categories: COVID-19 positive, pneumonia positive, and normal. To achieve this, we utilize the COVID-19 Chest X-ray dataset available on Kaggle.
