# COVID-19-Chest-X-ray-Classification-KNN

### Project Description:
This project aims to build a complete pattern recognition system to solve classification problems using the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The system is designed to classify chest X-ray images into three categories: COVID-19 positive, pneumonia positive, and normal. To achieve this, we utilize the COVID-19 Chest X-ray dataset available on Kaggle.

#### Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the [COVID-19 Chest X-ray dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/covid-wwo-pneumonia-chest-xray) which consists of chest X-ray images labeled as COVID-19 positive, pneumonia positive, and normal.

#### Techniques Used:
1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm**: KNN is a simple and effective algorithm used for classification problems.
2. **Centroids for Feature Exteraction**: centroids is used to extract features from data
3. **Swarm Optimization (Ant Colony) for Feature Selection**: Swarm optimization is utilized for feature selection, helping in identifying the most relevant features for classification.
4. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for Feature Reduction**: LDA is used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while preserving the class discriminatory information.



### Note:
- Make sure to download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/covid-wwo-pneumonia-chest-xray) and place it in the `data/` directory before running the code.
